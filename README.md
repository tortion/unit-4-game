# unit-4-game
This is the infamous Crystal Collector game

The game plays well now and I was successful at debugging the nagging problem related to the random number value insertion during the game reset function...

... but I did not have time to split the code into .js, .css, etc fully.

I'll do that as an update but for now, the game, code and styles are complete.
